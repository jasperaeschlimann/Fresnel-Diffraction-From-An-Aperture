## Introduction

Diffraction refers to the phenomenon of light bending around obstacles or through apertures, resulting in characteristic interference patterns. This Python program provides a computational solution for analyzing diffraction patterns, allowing users to simulate diffraction phenomena from both one-dimensional and two-dimensional apertures. By employing numerical integration methods such as Simpson's and Trapezium rules, the program accurately calculates the diffraction patterns for both near field effects (Fresnel diffraction) and far field effects (Fraunhofer diffraction).

## Installation

Simply download or clone the Python file `fresnel_diffraction.py` from this repository to your local machine. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. No additional dependencies are required.

## Report
A detailed PDF `Report.pdf` is included in this repository. This report contains comprehensive documentation of the theoretical calculations and findings obtained from the diffraction simulations performed by the program. It offers some insight into suitable parameters for generating diffraction patterns.
